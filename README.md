# Fanpage-Website
Simple fanpage HTML website for the New York Yankees. The homepage, which you are obviously greeted by, consists of a title at the top of the page, a description of the website, tabs to go to other pages, links to the official Yankees website and the official Yankees YouTube channel, interesting facts, and two embedded videos that you can watch without having to leave the website. The tabs for the other pages you can go to include the roster for the team (2021), an MVP fan signup which I developed in JavaScript to get fans to enter their emails to recieve emails about news on the Yankees and possibly highlight videos, the legnds which just listed some of the greatest players in Yankees history, show runners which were the office folk of who was running the team at the time, and lastly a history page.
